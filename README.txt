This is for class, Data Science. I am learning a lot, having never used command-line before. I did not have Github make a readme when I created the repository. Now I will add this to GitHub from my local git.
Here are some useful commands:
1. use <<git add>> command to add all new local files to your local git bash Revision Control Section
2. use <<git commit -m "your message">> command to update your local repository
3. use <<git pull origin master>> command to synchronise your web and local repo
4. use <<git push origin master>> command to send your file to your github account

'git add/rm <file>'
